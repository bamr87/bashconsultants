# bashconsultants

The source for **[bash-365.com](https://bash-365.com)** — the site of BASH Consulting (Bourne Again Solutions Hero), a Denver-based IT consulting practice for small and medium businesses. This is a dual-purpose repository:

1. **Jekyll site** (repo root) — the marketing and content site, built on the [`bamr87/zer0-mistakes`](https://github.com/bamr87/zer0-mistakes) remote theme and deployed on every push to `main`.
2. **VS Code extension** (`extension/`) — *Prompt Orchestrator*, a self-contained TypeScript extension that runs the shared prompt library in `.github/prompts/` from inside the editor.

The site is also a working demonstration of how the firm operates: it is written, reviewed, illustrated, validated, and shipped through a governed AI pipeline. See [`/tools/`](https://bash-365.com/tools/) and [`/ai-operations/`](https://bash-365.com/ai-operations/).

## Services

The site presents eight service areas — AI and intelligent automation, cloud architecture, ERP consulting, financial systems, data and business intelligence, custom software development, IT strategy, and managed IT — under [`/services/`](https://bash-365.com/services/). Service pages live in `pages/_services/`.

## Quick start (Jekyll site)

The site builds Docker-first; the host Ruby on most machines is too old for the theme (requires Ruby ≥ 3.2).

```bash
# Local dev server → http://localhost:4042 (livereload on 35730)
docker-compose up

# One-off build validation (matches the local dev stack)
docker-compose exec jekyll bundle exec jekyll build \
  --config '_config.yml,_config_dev.yml'

docker-compose down
```

**Git worktrees:** the theme is mounted from a sibling checkout. Point the mount at the real checkout with `ZER0_MISTAKES_PATH` (defaults to `../zer0-mistakes`):

```bash
ZER0_MISTAKES_PATH=/path/to/zer0-mistakes docker-compose up
```

A `.devcontainer/` is provided for Codespaces and container-based editors.

## Quick start (extension)

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run lint && npm run compile && npm test
```

The extension runs from source (it is not published to the Marketplace). See [`extension/README.md`](extension/README.md) and [`extension/QUICKSTART.md`](extension/QUICKSTART.md).

## Build and deploy

Every push to `main` triggers two deploys, gated by CI:

| Stack | Config | Theme | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | `_config.yml` | `remote_theme: bamr87/zer0-mistakes@v1.26.0` (safe mode) | Static only; custom `_plugins/` do not run |
| Azure Static Web Apps | `_config.yml` + `_config.azure.yml` (`Gemfile.azure`) | `jekyll-theme-zer0 ~> 1.26.0` gem | Also hosts the `/api/` chat function; PRs get a staging URL |

`.github/workflows/build-validate.yml` builds **both** production stacks and runs the content linter on every push and pull request. Automation (nightly site-health, weekly content drafts, the AI chat proxy) is documented in [`docs/automation.md`](docs/automation.md).

## Contributing conventions

- **Read the guidance first.** [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the entry point for AI agents; [`.github/instructions/`](.github/instructions/) holds the authoritative editorial and code rules per file path.
- **Validate before declaring done.** Jekyll changes → run the Docker build. Extension changes → `npm run lint && npm run compile && npm test`.
- **Conventional commits:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Don't mix Jekyll-site and `extension/` changes in one commit.
- **Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** for user-visible changes.
- **Never commit** `_site/`, `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, or secrets.
