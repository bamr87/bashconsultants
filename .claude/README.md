# `.claude/` — the native Claude context framework

This directory is the Claude Code layer for the bashconsultants repository. It is the reference implementation of the operating model the site describes at [`/ai-operations/`](../ai-operations.md) and teaches partners at [`/tools/partners/claude-context-framework/`](../pages/_toolkit/claude-context-framework.md): **rules in files, reusable playbooks, agents that draft, humans who approve.**

Start at the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). This file maps what lives here and when to reach for it.

## Which primitive do I use?

| I want to… | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Do a recurring task the governed way | a **skill** | Encodes the steps + standards so output is repeatable. |
| Hand off a self-contained job | a **subagent** | Runs in its own context; keeps the main thread clean. |
| Give a human a one-word trigger | a **command** | Discoverable as `/name`; wraps a skill or agent. |
| Make a rule apply without being asked | an **instruction** (`.github/instructions/`) or a **hook** | Auto-loads on matching files, or fires on a tool event. |
| Remember a decision between sessions | **agent memory** | Same correction never has to be made twice. |

## Relationship to `.github/`

The repo predates the Claude-native layer and already has a mature **cross-tool** AI surface under `.github/` — `AGENTS.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, `instructions/`, and the `prompts/` library that Copilot and the extension consume. That stays authoritative and tool-neutral.

`.claude/` does not replace it. It **specializes** it for Claude Code:

- **Instructions** (`.github/instructions/`) are shared rules; skills and agents here cite them
  rather than restating them. The brand and content-style files are the source of truth.
- **Prompts** (`.github/prompts/`) are the portable playbooks; the richer **skills** here are their
  Claude-native counterparts. Keep a shared workflow in sync across both when you change it.

When you add a capability, add it at the right layer: a *rule* → an instruction; a *portable playbook* → a prompt; a *Claude-native procedure* → a skill; a *delegated job* → an agent; a *trigger* → a command. One concern per file.

## Conventions for authoring here

- **Skills:** `skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter `name` (kebab-case, matches the
directory) and `description` (one line, when-to-use — this is what Claude matches on). Bundle helper scripts alongside `SKILL.md` when a step should be deterministic.
- **Agents:** `agents/<kebab-name>.md` with frontmatter `name`, `description` (include trigger
  examples), `model`, optional `color`, optional `memory: project`.
- **Commands:** `commands/<name>.md` with frontmatter `description` (and optional `argument-hint`,
  `allowed-tools`); the filename is the `/name`.
- Keep every file **short and single-purpose**, and cross-link with relative paths so the graph stays
  navigable. Match the house voice — these files are read by people evaluating how BASH works.
